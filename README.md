OKX API SCRYPTS

## Who will find these scripts useful?
1. For users who repeatedly need to collect their airdrops from sub-accounts to Main.
2. Or users who need to quickly sell their airdrops from multiple accounts.

## How to set up the script to run?
1. Generate an [API Key](https://support.cryptact.com/hc/en-us/articles/10076952807193-How-to-get-an-API-key-for-OKX). Be sure to add Read and Trade permissions.
2. Insert your keys into the **accounts.txt** file. If you are using a proxy, add them to the same file.
3. Configure the scripts in the **config.py** file.
4. Run the script and test the bot's functionality with a balance request operation.

## Account setup
The script can initialize multiple accounts. Each account is specified on a new line.
Enter your account details in the exact order as specified in the template.

**account_id** is the account identifier; enter any string. It will be displayed in the script logs.

## Donate
If you found my bot useful and it brought you a few hundred USD more, or saved you time, send a little something to the developer for a beer :)
